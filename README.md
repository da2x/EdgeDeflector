# EdgeAndBingDeflector

*EdgeAndBingDeflector* is  a small helper application that intercepts URIs that force-open web links in Microsoft Edge and redirects it to the system’s default web browser, along with changing the search engine to Google. This allows you to use Windows features like the Cortana assistant and built-in help links with the browser of your choice instead of being forced to use Microsoft Edge. With EdgeAndBingDeflector, you’re free to use Firefox, Google Chrome, or whatever your favorite web browser with Google search engine!

You’ll never see EdgeAndBingDeflector  ever again after installing it. It does its thing transparently in the background and only runs when a link needs to be deflected away from Microsoft Edge.

System requirements: Windows 10, and your favorite web browser.
